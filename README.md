# seatsio-python, the official Seats.io Python client library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seatsio/seatsio-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seatsio/seatsio-python)

This is the official Python client library for the [Seats.io V2 REST API](https://www.seats.io/docs/api-v2).

## Installing

## Versioning

seatsio-python only uses major version numbers: v5, v6, v7 etc. Each release - backwards compatible or not - receives a new major version number.

The reason: we want to play safe and assume that each release _might_ break backwards compatibility.
